# Task 1 - Introduction

NO ANSWER NEEDED

# Task 2 - Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research 


You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner? (Yay/Nay)

R/ **Yay**


You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this?

R/ **Injection**


You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?

R/ **Broken Access Control**

#Task 3 - Finding Manual Exploits 


What website would you use as a security researcher if you wanted to upload a Proof of Concept?

R/ **Github**


You are performing a penetration test at a site with no internet connection. What tool could you use to find exploits to use?

R/ **searchsploit**


#Task 4 - Example of Manual Exploitation 


What type of vulnerability was used in this attack?

R/ **Remote code execution**

# Task 5 -Practical: Manual Exploitation 


Find out the version of the application that is running. What are the name and version number of the application?

R/ **The version of the application can be found on the lower right corner of the site provided by THM**.


Now use the resources and skills from this module to find an exploit that will allow you to gain remote access to the vulnerable machine.

R/ **No answer needed**


Use this exploit against the vulnerable machine. What is the value of the flag located in a web directory?


R/ First, you need to find an exploit. You can find it using searchsploit. Using the following command you can find it: searchsploit online book store.

We will observe the exploit "Unauthenticate Remote Access", we will use this exploit to attack the vulnerable application. You can download the exploit directly from exploitdb.com. 

Once you have downloaded the exploit, let's proceed to use it against the vulnerable application. Before executing it you need to set the URL of the vulnerable application. Exploit command: **python 47887.py ADD URL HERE**. The exploit will open a shell session, you can search the file "flag.txt" and you will get the response.
